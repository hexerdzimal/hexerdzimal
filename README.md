# hexerdezimal


👨‍💻 37, tech-enthusiast, and a lifelong learner

🎓 Bachelor’s in Computer Science (almost done!) with a focus on IT Security & Forensics—heading into my Master’s soon.

💼 By day, I’m a ServiceNow Consultant diving into SecOps and platform solutions.



🔧 Tech Stack: Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, SQL, ServiceNow, GitHub, Miro, Discord (Bots), VSCode, and Eclipse.


💡 Passionate about these current projects:


 - Creating a polyglot data tool.
   
 - Building supply-chain security monitoring solutions for software development.
   
 - Enhancing security frameworks with ServiceNow.
   

🔒 I thrive on the constant evolution of IT security—thinking ahead of attackers and mastering multiple layers of technology.


🤝 Soft skills: Teamwork is my jam, I’m a fast learner (thanks, hyperfocus!), and I love solving problems creatively.


🐾 Beyond tech: I am a dogfather and a father of two amazing daughters. I enjoy Qi Gong, dream of finding a sport I can stick with, and plan to travel the world.

🧙‍♂️ Why the name "hexerdzimal"?

   It’s a play on hexadecimal and "Hexer" (the German word for "Witcher"). Because let's face it: Computer science beats magic any day—real spells don’t debug themselves! 🪄💻. Ah yeah... and because of my long hair?!


🎯 Goals:


 - Deepen my IT sec-skills alongside my ServiceNow expertise to bring real value to clients.
 - Keep growing personally and professionally while staying curious and adaptable.

🚀 Let’s build, learn, and innovate together!
